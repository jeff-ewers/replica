        "description": "Mechanisms driving sex differences across islet cells is unknown. Thus, studying sex differences in islet regulation and function represent a unique avenue to understand the sex-specific heterogeneity in Î² cell failure in diabetes. We examined sex and race differences in human pancreatic islets from 15 donors using an orthogonal series of experiments including single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), single nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snATAC-seq), dynamic hormone secretion, and bioenergetics.",

        "description": "Recent advances in machine learning have leveraged evolutionary information in multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structure. We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.",
